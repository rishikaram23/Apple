			<h2>iPhone 11 Pro</h2>
			<p>The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are smartphones designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the 13th-generation flagship iPhones, succeeding the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, respectively. Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the devices alongside a lower-end model, the iPhone 11, on September 10, 2019, at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. Pre-orders began on September 13, 2019, and the phones went on sale on September 20.

Key upgrades over the previous devices include the triple-lens rear camera system and the A13 Bionic chip. The 11 Pro is Apple's first iPhone to feature a "pro" designation, which was previously used only for larger Apple devices, such as the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro, and the first to include an 18 W fast charger and a Lightning to USB-C cable that allows connection to the charger and to current Mac computers, in the box.</p><br>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The iPhone 11 Pro is available in Gold, Silver, Space Gray, and Midnight Green, a new color previously not available on iPhones. Similar to the iPhone XS, there is a display cutout at the front that includes the 12 MP TrueDepth camera system and speaker. There is also a new rear camera design with three lenses and a flash in a larger, square-shaped bump, which is the most visible difference compared to the iPhone XS. The Apple logo is now centered on the back of the device with no text, and the glass has a frosted matte finish, unlike the glossy finish found on other glass-backed iPhones.</p><br>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max both have an A13 Bionic processor. Both phones have three internal storage options: 64 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB, and have 4 GB of RAM. Both models are rated IP68 water and dust resistant, and are resistant for 30 minutes at a depth of 4 meters. The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone. Also, like previous iPhones, both phones do not have a headphone jack, and come with wired EarPods with a Lightning connector. The iPhone 11 Pro is the first iPhone to be sold with an 18 watt fast charger in the box as opposed to the 5 watt charger in the iPhone XS and previous iPhones.</p><br>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>The iPhone 11 Pro has a 5.85 inch (marketed as 5.8 inch) OLED display with a resolution of 2436 × 1125 pixels (2.7 megapixels at 458 ppi), while the iPhone 11 Pro Max has a 6.46 inch (marketed as 6.5 inch) OLED display with a resolution of 2688 × 1242 pixels (3.3 megapixels at 458 ppi). Both models feature a Super Retina XDR Display with a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio and a notch at the top for the TrueDepth camera system and speaker. Apple describes the display as having a "mini Apple Pro Display XDR" on a phone. They also have a True Tone and wide color display supporting HDR with 800 nits of standard brightness and 1200 nits peak brightness if necessary. The screen has an oleophobic coating that is fingerprint-resistant. The display of the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max is made by Samsung.</p><br>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max both include a triple-lens 12 MP rear camera array. There is one ƒ/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens with a 120-degree field of view and 2x optical zoom out, one ƒ/1.8 wide-angle lens, and one ƒ/2.0 telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom in. There is a burst mode, image stabilization, HDR, and a portrait mode with supporting an advanced bokeh effect. The phones support a Portrait Mode supporting depth control and an advanced bokeh effect. The phone also has an automatic Night Mode allowing the camera to take brighter pictures with reduced noise in low light environments. There is also a redesigned camera app that adds new features such as a scroll wheel for choosing between the different lenses and long-pressing the shutter button to take a video. Apple has also announced a new Deep Fusion feature which will take advantage of AI and machine learning for image processing.</p><br>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max was initially supplied with iOS 13, released on September 19, 2019. The phone also comes with Siri, Face ID (through the TrueDepth camera), Apple Pay, and supports Apple Card.</p>
