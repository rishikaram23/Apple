			<h2>iPhone SE</h2>
			<p>The first-generation iPhone SE (also known as the original iPhone SE or the 2016 iPhone SE) is a smartphone that was designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It is part of the 9th generation of the iPhone alongside the higher-end iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. It was announced on March 21, 2016 at the Town Hall auditorium in the Apple Campus by Apple executive Greg Joswiak, with pre-orders beginning on March 24, 2016. It was officially released on March 31, 2016.

It was re-released almost a year later on March 24, 2017 with larger storage capacities. iPhone SE shares the same physical design and dimensions as iPhone 5S, but has upgraded internal hardware, including the newer Apple A9 system-on-chip, greater battery capacity, and a 12-megapixel rear camera that can record up to 4K video at 30 frames per second. The name SE is an acronym for Special Edition. iPhone SE was discontinued by Apple on September 12, 2018.

Its successor, the second-generation iPhone SE, was announced on April 15, 2020 and released on April 24, 2020.</p><br>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The exterior design of iPhone SE is nearly identical to that of iPhone 5 and 5S, with the exception of matte-chamfered edges and an inset stainless steel rear Apple logo. iPhone SE shares the same physical sizes and dimensions, so cases designed to fit the 5 and 5S will also fit an iPhone SE.iPhone SE was available in the colors Space Gray, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold.</p><br>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>iPhone SE incorporates the Apple A9 system-on-chip (SoC) with an M9 motion coprocessor and supports near field communication for Apple Pay. It was originally released with 16 GB or 64 GB of internal storage. It features a 12 megapixel rear-facing camera with the ability to record 2160p (4K) video at 30 frames per second and slow motion with 1080p at 120fps and 720p at 240fps options. The camera lacks optical image stabilization.

Unlike iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the SE does not include 3D Touch, nor the updated faster second-generation Touch ID sensor from the 6s and 6s Plus,or its barometer.

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.

On March 21, 2017 Apple announced that it would double the storage for these models at the same launch prices. The upgraded models were released on March 24, 2017 with 32 GB or 128 GB of internal storage.</p><br>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>iPhone SE originally shipped with iOS 9.3, supporting iPhone 6- and 6S-exclusive features such as Apple Pay, Live Photos, Retina Flash, and always-on Siri voice activation. The SE is compatible with iOS 13. During the WWDC 2019 Keynote, Apple announced, that iPhone SE, 6S, and 6S Plus would support most of the main features of iOS 13. This includes the new dark mode (which aims to reduce eye strain), and Low Data Mode for restricting background network (both Wi-Fi and mobile network) usage. Along with iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, iPhone SE is the oldest iPhone to support iOS 14.</p>
